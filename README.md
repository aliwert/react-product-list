- API Integration: Movie data is retrieved from an external API to provide accurate and up-to-date information.<br>
- User-friendly Interface: The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, enhancing the user experience.<br>
- In this project, I didn't write the data myself; instead, I worked with data fetched from an external source.
